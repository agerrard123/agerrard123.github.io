        <p>Thanos is a fictional alien warlord appearing in multiple Marvel movies. He was born with a unique appearance on the planet Titan and was shunned as a child, which fuelled his cynical views. He is known for his strength and intellect, but also for his ability to anialate entire civilizations and planets. Believing the Universe's recourses were finite, he aimed to restore balance through mass genocide. To accomplish this, he pursued the six Infinity Stones, which would allow him to complete his goal.</p>

        <p>He commands an army called the Black Order that would travel planet-to-planet, destroying them one by one in his search for the stones. Once he was in possesion of all six, a snap of his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet would turn half of all living thing into dust, hense accomplishing his goal. While he is seen as a supervillain, Thanos believes that his actions are justifiable and that overpopulation is the Universe's greatest threat. His search to obtain all six stones are not made easy, as the Avengers plan to stop him.</p>
